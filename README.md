# phone-from-video
extract phone numbers out of mp4 file.

Run the code, select a video, and if any phone numbers appear in it, they will be included in a text file at the end of the program.

There were 3 seperate programes:
    1. Convert the .mp4 to frames
    2. Delete similar frames
    3. Extract phone from photo
Now i combbined those into one. The same phases that occurred back then still take place in this version- only now they happen sequentially without requiring manual transitions between them.
